    <iframe src="figures/AllStatesTimeSeries.html"></iframe>
    <p>This chart visualizes average home prices, including single family homes and apartments / condos, in the 100 most populous cities in the US. These would be the average price a person pays for a home.</p>

    <p>However, young people may be more likely to rent a home for economic reasons like low current credit, low savings for a down payment, or flexibility if they do not want to settle down soon (See the values page for family values.) So, see the figure below for rent prices.</p>
    <iframe src="figures/AllStatesRentTimeSeries.html"></iframe>
    <p>This chart visualizes average rent prices, including multi-person units, in the 100 most populous cities in the US. These would be the average monthly rent for a lease signed at that time of year. Notice the seasonal pattern.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Section 2: Education Trends</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/Top200EducationMap.html"></iframe>
    <p>This map plots education scores done using a cohort study on K-12 students in public schools, by metro area. Notice the concentration of higher scores in urban centers in the Northeast (except Philadelphia and neighboring Camden), and the relatively poorer scores in the South and especially in Southern California. Marks are colored by their score and sized by the amount of tests conducted in that metro area, roughly relative to the population size of the metro area.</p>
