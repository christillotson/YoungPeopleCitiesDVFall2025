    <h2 id="section1">Section 1: Cost of Housing</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/AllStatesTimeSeries.html"></iframe>
    <p>This chart visualizes average home prices, including single family homes and apartments / condos, in the 100 most populous cities in the US. These would be the average price a person pays for a home.</p>
    <p>Double click on a state to the right to show only cities in that state, and click more states to enable more.</p>
    <p>However, young people may be more likely to rent a home for economic reasons like low current credit, low savings for a down payment, or flexibility if they do not want to settle down soon (See the values page for family values.) So, see the figure below for rent prices.</p>
    <iframe src="figures/AllStatesRentTimeSeries.html"></iframe>
    <p>This chart visualizes average rent prices, including multi-person units, in the 100 most populous cities in the US. These would be the average monthly rent for a lease signed at that time of year. Notice the seasonal pattern.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Section 2: Education Trends</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/Top200EducationMap.html"></iframe>
    <p>This map plots education scores done using a cohort study on K-12 students in public schools, by metro area. Notice the concentration of higher scores in urban centers in the Northeast (except Philadelphia and neighboring Camden), and the relatively poorer scores in the South and especially in Southern California. Marks are colored by their score and sized by the amount of tests conducted in that metro area, roughly relative to the population size of the metro area. Look around and zoom in to get a better view of certain areas with a large concentration of cities.</p>


    <h2 id="section3">Section 3: Violent Crime Rates</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/Violent_Crime.html"></iframe>
    <p>This scatterplot contains the population, violent crime count, and violent crime percent data for all U.S cities and counties with a population over 500,000. The data is log scaled along the y axis due to differences in orders of magnitude of population of cities. </p>
    <p>Hover over a point to see the city name and all the data asociated with it.</p>
    <iframe src="figures/Violent_Crime_Percent_Change.html"></iframe>
    <p>This bar chart shows the percentage change in violent crime rates for all the cities in the above scatterplot. This percent change is calculated with violent crime data from 07/2023-06/2024 and 07/2024-06/2025.</p>
    <p>Notice how for most of the cities the percent change is negative meaning the violent crime decreased. If safety is highly valued for young people then they should consider moving to a city where the violent crime is decreasing year over year.</p>

    <h2 id="section4">Section 4: Income</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/Per Capita Personal Income.html"></iframe>
    <p>This chart takes data from three different years, 2021 to 2023, regarding per capita income in various metropolitan areas in the United States. The top 25 metropolitan areas by average per capita income are represented in the graph. Exact per capita income values can be found by hovering over each dot in the scatterplot. Use the bar at the bottom of the visualization to view the changes in per capita income throughout this three year span.</p>
