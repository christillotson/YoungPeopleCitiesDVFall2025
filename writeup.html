    <p> Instructions just to have them here:

    Written Component: All projects should have a written component that includes the initial research
    question/purpose, the data used (briefly), the steps you took in analysis and visualization (again, this can be
    brief), and a thorough discussion of what your visualizations show, how they relate to the original
    question/purpose, and what insights they reveal. For some project formats, this will not be separate – for
    example, if you are creating a web page, you will just have the text on the web page. Please ask if you are
    uncertain.

    <p>May need a separate References section in this with different style for any sources cited, do later</p>
