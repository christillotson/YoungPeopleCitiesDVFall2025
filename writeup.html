    <p>Our initial research purpose was to look into where young people should move after graduation. While our initial thought was just to look at qualities of places, we realised only visualizing qualities of places may be flawed due to a reflection of our own bias. What we inherently value in a place to live may not be the same as what other young people value, so we wanted to gather and visualize that data as well before making any broad conclusions. Additionally, we decided to focus on cities / metro areas due to their appeal to young people and how settlement patterns generally focus around the nearest large city.</p>
    <p>We researched several different sources of data. For the values of young people, we found a survey done by Gallup of GenZ people, which was right around the age range we wanted to focus on. For city qualities, we found data published by Zillow on home values as well as average rents by metro area, considering that most young people are probably not in a position to buy a house immediately after graduation. We also found a study of K-12 public school published by the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), and we “geocoded” this data to find locations to put on a map (see Sources subpage on the webpage for more info). We geocoded this data because the metropolitan areas were named in such a way that we could not find a matching .json with locations, but we manually verified these locations were accurately positioned. Further digging yielded a dataset covering per capita income statistics covering 2021, 2022, and 2023. This data also showed percent changes between the years. We also found a FBI dataset containing all types of crime data in different U.S cities. We used this to look at the violent crime rates across all major cities to see which would be the safest for a young person to move to.</p>
    <p>Looking at our time series Zillow data, it made sense to make a time series line graph, so we just had to clean that up and put it into line plots. For the survey data related to young peoples’ values, the questions were consistently asked the same way with the same types of answers, so it was a matter of making one bar chart and then repeating that code for different groups of questions. We also decided to use a custom diverging color map here to improve readability. The education data, while coming almost completely cleaned, did not have location data, so it was a matter of geocoding (see the sources webpage for more details) and then deciding on a good color ramp, size, zoom, etc. We decided to use a dark gray basemap because the marks towards the middle of the scale were difficult to see on a light gray basemap. The per capita income data was formatted into an interactive scattermap covering all three years, 2021 to 2023. This was to visually show the changes in the numbers over that time. As for the crime data, we wanted to look at the violent crime percentage for cities rather than the raw count. This is so we can equally compare cities with huge population differences. </p>
    <p>From the plots on young peoples’ values, we can see that young people just want to have a good time. They are not concerned with climbing the corporate ladder and only want enough income to live comfortably, though they definitely still do want a high income. This means that high income cities will be valued, such as those we can see in the Northeast (especially around NYC), as well as California (though perhaps not California if they do eventually want to start a family or keep most of their income, see the education section and income section below).</p>
    <p>From the plots of housing costs and rent, we can see that young people are going to have a much harder time buying a house today than 20 or even 10 years ago, with very high spikes recently. However, rents have only risen steadily - in both cases, these plots are informative to anyone trying to decide where to move to, because large cities can be easily found by filtering for state here. Overall, it appears that California is an incredibly expensive place to live, and so is NYC. However, rents are clustered in mid-size cities from about $1100 to $2000 a month, which will give young people a good idea of what a “good deal” may be, as well as what to expect should they decide to move somewhere. Additionally, several Southern states, such as Texas, consistently have low housing costs (both home prices and rents), which may be related to trends we read often in the news of people moving to the “Sunbelt”. However, education (see below) is a drawback of this area.</p>
    <p>From the map of education scores, we can see that, though there are high housing costs, the Northeast should not be discounted due to their excellent public education. Though fewer young people value starting a family than maintaining their current relationships, a majority still do, and these values could change. For this reason, they should consider the several large metro areas in the Northeast (with the exception of Philadelphia), as well as much of the Northern Midwest and Seattle (so, generally the North of the US) as attractive places to move.</p>
    <p>From the scatterplot we can see that there is not much relation between population size and violent crime rates. This is good because it means whether young people prefer large or small cities their safety will not be impacted. We can also see that some of the most dangerous cities such as Memphis, Kansas City, and Baltimore live up to what we hear on the news. This is good as it tells us our data is reliable. We also decided to make a diverging bar chart. This was to help visualize the percent change using the same data in the scatter plot along with the data from the year before. From the bar chart we can see that most of the cities had a decreasing violent crime rate. This is good as it means for the U.S as a whole violent crime is decreasing. However, there were some exceptions, we see some cities such as Fresno, Oklahoma City, and Portland that increased in violent crime. </p>
    <p>From the plot of personal income, we can see that the Northeast and California both generally have high income levels. Another interesting feature here are the several metropolitan areas from Florida, with few from other Southern states. Combined with the middling public education scores, this would suggest Florida cities as another attractive area for young people. These specific metro areas, with high incomes, can be interpreted two different ways: firstly, that if incomes are high here, one is likely to also find a job with a high income, or secondly, that if incomes are high, prices and costs of living would be increased by businesses. So, this depends on the young person’s career choice - if they fall in the minority of people who are seeking a manager level position, perhaps they are likely to find a very good job in these places and be able to survive the high costs, but if they fall in the majority who do not, then perhaps these are actually cities to be avoided.</p>
    <p>The sources for all conclusions are simply our own data and visualizations.</p>
