    <h2 id="section1">Section 1: Family Values</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/famvalues_barplot0.html"></iframe>
    <p>This plot visualizes how young people feel about certain "family values", based on their responses to three different questions. It appears that young people value established relationships and, though overall do want to start families, value this less so. Therefore, it is likely that young people will gravitate more towards cities with characteristics that enhance their quality of life, and place less importance on characteristics that only influence the ease of starting a family.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Section 2: Personal Values</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/values_barplot_personal.html"></iframe> <!-- placeholder until make other plots to put in-->
    <p>This plot visualizes what young people value about their personal lives. Young people are very interested in their hobbies, having a happy life, and a good education, which follows with the previous trend of them most likely seeking out cities that increase their quality of life. Volunteering is only somewhat important to young people, and they seem split roughly 50/50 on the importance of religion, so for lack of a better way to say it, young people just want to party.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section3">Section 3: Economic Values</h2>
    <iframe src="figures/values_barplot_general_econ.html"></iframe>
    <p>This plot above visualizes general economic values, while the one below looks specifically at what a young person wants from their job. Young people more than anything just want to live comfortably, and don’t all need to be super rich. Some do want to be wealthy, but more so to just have their dream job. Despite modern rhetoric around the expensive housing market, they still overall more want to, eventually, buy a home, so it is still important to look at home prices and their trends in addition to rent. Overall, young people don’t care too much to start a business or be an upper level manager / boss - money is more important than work prestige, which indicates that they will chase a higher income.
    </p>
    <iframe src="figures/values_barplot_dream_job.html"></iframe>
    <p>This plot reflects many of the same trends we have seen above. Young people want a decent income, but enough to be comfortable, and are not seeking high stress work positions. Overall, it is important to them for their job to involve creativity, benefitting the community, and learning new things, however surprisingly traveling is not so important, so even small cities without great travel infrastructure like airports or Amtrak stations are viable places to move to.
