NOTE 

These files provided in the case that other ways to access them does not work, but just in this folder for file organization. They are designed to work with all data in our "data" folder, but to operate in a top level directory with a "data" folder in the same directory as these .ipynbs.

So, to make these work, one would need to move the data folder *into* this directory, or move all of these into the outer main directory. They will create the .htmls in the same directory that the .ipynbs are in.
